// 1791. Find Center of Star Graph

// There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. 
// A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.
// You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.

/**
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}

var findCenter = function(edges) {
  console.log(edges[0][0]);
  console.log(edges[1][1]);
